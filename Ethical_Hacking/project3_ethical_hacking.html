Project 3 - Ethical Hacking 

Scenario
After successfully installing a network upgrade for your company’s client, you have been asked to 
perform another cybersecurity service for that client. The client hired a consultant to install and 
configure a new server in their internal network to support production and operations. You are tasked 
with determining the vulnerabilities of the new Production server and provide specific examples of how 
any vulnerabilities could be exploited. You are also asked to perform the same service on the Webserver 
in their DMZ. 

Project Tasks 
A network diagram is attached to this document showing the installation of the new Production server. 
Use this as a guide for completing this project, and feel free to use it in your presentation if you wish. 
This project adds to the VirtualBox network you created in Project 1. If you removed that network, you 
will be responsible for restoring it to full functionality. 

By successfully completing this project, you will have demonstrated your ability to scan a computer to 
enumerate vulnerabilities, analyze those vulnerabilities for exploitability, execute exploits against a 
target computer and create persistence. 

Project tasks are as follows: 
1. Install the supplied Production server VM into the Trusted network in VirtualBox. 

2. Use tools within Kali Linux to enumerate all vulnerabilities on the Production server. Research 
the severity of the vulnerabilities using CVE numbers. 

3. Use tools within Kali Linux to enumerate all vulnerabilities on the Web server. Research the 
severity of the vulnerabilities using CVE numbers. 

4. Exploit at least 2 of the vulnerabilities you found on the Production server, one of which must 
give you root access to the server. 

5. Exploit at least 2 of the vulnerabilities you found on the Web server, one of which must give you 
root access to the server. These should be different vulnerabilities than you found on the 
production server. 

6. Create your own “backdoor” account on the Production server that has root permissions.  

7. Look for any interesting files on the Production and Web servers. 

8. Bonus: crack the passwords for the users configured on the Production server. 

9. Provide recommendations to improve server security.
